# dp_sympy
I hope to develop this repos as a bifurcation analysis tool for complex dynamical systems using sympy (Original:[aw02m](https://github.com/aw02m/discrete_bif_sympy)).


So far, The Jacobi matrix of the system, the equilibrium points, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be calculated.

However, there may be some problems in terms of calculation speed and accuracy.

***

## Requirements
* python(3.9~)
* sympy
* numpy
* scipy

## Usage

```python dp.py in.json```
